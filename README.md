# Matched runs, unpaired test: recovering a discarded pairing in a small personalisation comparison, and pre-registering the one that would settle it

Identity and caption-fidelity records, adapter manifests, paired concept-by-seed figures and manuscript source for a re-analysis that recovers the pairing a small diffusion-personalisation comparison discarded, reports what the registered identity endpoint can support, and separates its prompt-fidelity secondary endpoint from the protocol design. The official 1000-step B-LoRA result is absent.

## What is here

- `paper/tex/` — manuscript source
- `paper/figs/` — the R code that draws the figures and writes the printed numbers
- `paper/evidence/` — a file list with SHA-256 hashes
- `data/` — the 28 data files named in that list

## Not included

This archive leaves out one extra file named in the paper's evidence list. The paper does not take any number from it.

- A private working note. The paper does not use any number from it. Those facts are already in the methods and in the result files included here.

## Rebuild

```bash
bash build.sh
```

The build checks every data file against its hash and stops if a file has
changed. Figures and printed numbers are generated from those files, not typed
in by hand.

Requires `python3`, `Rscript` with `digest`, `ggplot2`, `jsonlite` and
`systemfonts`, and a TeX distribution with `latexmk`.

## Status
